# Varar + Ruby + RSpec

A standalone sample project that runs Markdown specs as RSpec examples with
[Varar](https://varar.dev).

The `*.md` files at the project root are the specs — plain Markdown prose that
runs as tests. `steps/*.steps.rb` bind the sentences to Ruby inside a
`steps(...) do … end` block with `stimulus`/`sensor` (and `param` for custom
types). `varar.config.json` says which files are specs (`docs`) and where the
step definitions live (`steps`).

## Run

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```

`spec/var_spec.rb` calls `Varar::RSpec.generate`, which turns every
matched spec into one RSpec example group with one `it` per Markdown example
(header-bound table rows are separate examples). A paragraph that used to match
a step and no longer does fails as **drift**; re-run with `VAR_UPDATE=1` to
accept it. The committed `varar.lock.json` is that drift baseline.
