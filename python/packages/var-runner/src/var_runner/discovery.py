      directory segments (the surrounding slashes are absorbed into the token).
    - ``/**`` at end of pattern → ``(?:/.*)?``  optional trailing path.
    - ``**/`` not preceded by ``/`` (leading or after a literal) → ``(?:.*/)?``
      zero or more path segments including the trailing slash, so a leading ``**/``
      matches both root-level paths and nested ones.
    - bare ``**`` elsewhere → ``.*``.
    - ``*``  → ``[^/]*``  (any chars except ``/``).
