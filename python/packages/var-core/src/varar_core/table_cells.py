"""
Parse a Markdown/Gherkin table row into trimmed cells and per-cell source spans.

Port of: typescript/packages/var-core/src/table-cells.ts

UTF-16 rule: all offsets (including line_start_offset and emitted Span offsets)
count UTF-16 code units, matching JavaScript's native string indexing so that
span values are identical between the TS and Python implementations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    line_text:
        The raw text of the row (e.g. ``"| a | b |"``).
    line_start_offset:
        UTF-16 offset of the first character of *line_text* within *source*.
    source:
        The full document source (used by :func:`span_from_offsets` to compute
        line/column coordinates).

    -------
    (cells, cell_spans)
        *cells* — tuple of trimmed cell strings.
        *cell_spans* — tuple of :class:`~var.span.Span` objects, one per cell,
        with ``start_offset``/``end_offset`` in UTF-16 units pointing at the
        trimmed cell text within *source*.
