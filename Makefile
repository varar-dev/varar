# Releasing is two steps, both on main (see doc/RELEASING.md):
#
#   make prepare   # bump every port + write CHANGELOG.md, commit & push to main
#   make release   # publish every registry, then tag + create the GitHub release
#
# prepare infers the version from conventional commits; pass VERSION=x.y.z only
# to override (e.g. the deliberate 1.0.0). release reads the prepared version
# from the manifests — no argument. Both are idempotent; re-run on failure.
