/**
 * Formats a caught step exception into human-readable text — a pure formatter over
 * {@link Failure#toFailure}'s {@link Result.ExampleFailure} payload. {@code var-junit}'s
 * engine work uses {@link #renderFailure} to build the message passed to JUnit
 * Platform's {@code TestExecutionResult.failed(Throwable)}.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately does not re-inspect {@code error}'s type itself: {@link
 * Failure#toFailure} already dispatches cell-mismatch vs. doc-string-mismatch vs.
 * everything else and extracts the failing line; this class only renders whatever it
 * already produced.
 *
 * <p>{@link Result.CellFailure} carries only {@code from}/{@code to} (absolute source
 * offsets) and {@code actual} — no {@code column} and no {@code expected} value is
 * stored there ({@code Failure.toFailure} deliberately drops both at this layer, since
 * the original markdown text at {@code [from, to)} IS the expected value, so it isn't
 * duplicated into the payload). So "expected" is rendered here by slicing {@code
 * source}, and no column name is available to render — a deliberate simplification
 * inherited from {@code Result.CellFailure}'s actual shape, not an oversight.
