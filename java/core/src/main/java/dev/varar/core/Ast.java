/**
 * AST node types produced by the parser/structurer — a direct port of
 * {@code var-core/src/ast.ts} (type definitions only; that file carries no logic).
 *
 * <p>All node types are nested inside this single class rather than declared as
 * top-level types, one per file. Java allows only one public top-level type per
 * file (its name must match the file name), but every node here needs to be
 * {@code public} — later ports (the {@code var} facade, {@code var-junit},
 * {@code var-runner}) live in other packages and must reference {@link Block},
 * {@link VarDoc}, etc. directly. Nesting them as {@code public static} members of
 * {@code Ast} satisfies both constraints in one file, keeps a reviewable
 * module-for-module mapping with {@code ast.ts}, and avoids a dozen near-empty
 * one-record files for what is a pure-data module.
 *
 * <p>Every record with a {@code List} field defensively copies it into an
 * unmodifiable view via a compact canonical constructor ({@link List#copyOf}), so
 * the AST is immutable regardless of what a caller passes in — TS enforces this
 * with {@code readonly}/{@code ReadonlyArray}; Java records give no such guarantee
 * for reference-typed fields without doing it explicitly.
