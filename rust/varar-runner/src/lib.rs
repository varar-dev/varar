//! `var-runner` — the imperative shell shared by var test-runner adapters.
//!
//! Spec discovery (the shared glob semantics), planning/running examples,
//! failure rendering, and the filesystem `var.lock.json` baseline store for
//! drift. Contains no pipeline logic — it delegates to `var-core`. Steps are
//! supplied by the caller (Rust compiles step files in; there is no dynamic
//! `load_steps`), as a `Registry` plus a context factory.
//!
// `run_example` surfaces var-core's `StepFailure` by value, matching that
// crate's own `#![allow(clippy::result_large_err)]` public-API choice.
