title: The markup is yours
description: Why Varar never edits inline text, and why document formats are block-structure plugins.

Varar executes prose. That only stays trustworthy if the prose the matcher
sees is exactly the prose you wrote — so Varar follows one rule:

**Format plugins own block structure. Nobody touches inline text.**

## Inline text is explicit

Step matching runs against the raw characters of each sentence. Emphasis,
bold, links, inline code — none of it is stripped, normalized or rewritten.
`Maya borrowed *Emma*` contains two asterisks, and only an expression that
accounts for them will match.

That sounds stricter than it is. In practice a marked-up run is almost
always *data* — a book title, a product name — and data is what parameter
types are for. Emphasis is common enough that it ships built-in as `{emph}`:

```md
Maya borrowed {emph}, due back on {date}.
```

`Maya borrowed *Emma*` matches, and your handler receives `Emma` — the markers
stripped, the value intact. Any *other* notation that is really data — a
hashtag, a wiki link, a domain code — is a
[custom parameter](/reference/custom-parameters/) away. Put the markers in the
regexp and a **capture group** around the part that is the value:

```ts
tag: {
  regexp: /#(\w+)/,   // #urgent → urgent
}
```

The first capture group is what your handler receives — and the exact span an
editor highlights — so the `#` outside it stays notation with no `parse` needed
to strip it. (Leave the capture group out and the whole match is the value,
markers and all; that is when you reach for `parse`.) The markers are notation,
no different from the `£` in `£2.50`: the pattern takes them apart, `format`
puts them back, and neither Varar's core nor your handlers ever see markup they
didn't ask for.

An earlier design stripped emphasis before matching, so `*Emma*` invisibly
became `Emma`. It felt convenient and read as magic: expressions matched
text that wasn't in the document, and adding emphasis to a word silently
changed nothing — until it did. Explicit turned out to be better: what you
see in the document is what the matcher sees, and a styling change to a
matched sentence fails loudly instead of drifting quietly.

Two practical consequences:

- **Styling matched sentences is significant.** Emphasizing a word inside a
  matched sentence changes its text, and the match fails visibly. Narration
  — the prose around your matched sentences — can use any markup it likes.
- **Keep links and inline code out of matched sentences.** In narration
  they're fine; in a matched sentence the URL is just more characters.

## Formats are block structure

What does Markdown actually contribute to a spec? Sections (`#` headings
become example boundaries and `describe` scopes), prose blocks (paragraphs,
list items, blockquotes), tables, and fenced blocks (doc strings and
`error` fences). All of it is *block* structure. None of it is inline.

That boundary is what makes the format pluggable. The scanner already
accepts block-recognition plugins — the Gherkin-table plugin adds `| a | b |`
tables without separator rows — and Markdown's own block rules are on by
default for `.md` and `.mdx` files. A block marker like a list bullet or a
blockquote's `>` prefix belongs to the format, so it never reaches the
matcher; everything after it is your text, untouched.

Nothing about sentences, matching or comparison knows Markdown exists. A
future AsciiDoc plugin (`==` headings, `|===` tables, `----` blocks) would
slot into the same seam without changing how a single expression matches —
and since `{emph}` already accepts underscore emphasis (`_Emma_`), AsciiDoc's
emphasis notation keeps working with no change at all.
