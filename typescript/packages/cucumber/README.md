# @varar/cucumber

A migration-verification sandbox: one Gherkin feature file, two step-definition
implementations, three test runners — proving that the same business behavior
runs under both `cucumber-js` and `@varar/varar`.

This package is **private** and never published. It exists to answer a single
question while we shape the public API: *can a project move from
cucumber-js to varar by porting only the step definitions?*

## Layout

```
features/
  library.feature              real Gherkin, owned by cucumber-js
  library.feature.md  ->   symlink to library.feature, parsed by var

cucumber/steps/library.steps.ts   cucumber-js handlers (Given/When/Then + hooks)
steps/library.steps.ts            var handlers (stimulus/sensor + steps)

src/library.ts                    the shared domain (a tiny library catalogue)
```

Both runners exercise the same `src/library.ts`. The step definitions are
deliberately the same shape — only the imports and the registration calls
differ.

## Why a symlink

The `.feature` file is real Gherkin (`Feature:`, `Scenario:`, indented
`Given/When/Then`, `| ... |` table rows without a `|---|` separator, `"""`
doc strings). vitest's file matcher looks for `*.md`, so we symlink the
file under both names. Vite's `preserveSymlinks: true` keeps the extension
intact through the loader, so var sees a `.md` file whose contents are
Gherkin.

To make the var scanner understand Gherkin tables and doc strings the package
opts into two scanner plugins in `varar.config.json`:

```json
{
  "docs": { "include": ["features/**/*.feature"], "exclude": [] },
  "steps": ["steps/**/*.steps.ts"],
  "scannerPlugins": ["gherkinTables", "gherkinDocStrings"]
}
```

Plugins are off by default in `@varar/varar`; ordinary Markdown-native
`.md` files do not need them.

## Three runners

| Script | Runner | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpm test:cucumber` | cucumber-js | Loads `cucumber/steps/library.steps.ts`, runs `library.feature` |
| `pnpm test:var` | `@varar/cli` (`varar run`) | Loads `steps/library.steps.ts`, runs `library.feature.md` |
| `pnpm test:var-vitest` | vitest + `@varar/vitest` plugin | Same .md, executed through vitest's runner |
| `pnpm test` | all three in sequence | full sweep |

All three run the same scenario green.

## Wall-clock comparison

Locally, one scenario / three steps, Node 22:

| Runner | Wall clock (mean of 3) |
|---|---|
| cucumber-js | ~0.85 s |
| `varar run` (CLI) | ~0.74 s |
| `var` via vitest | ~1.5 s |

The vitest path pays the cost of spinning up vite's transform + worker
plumbing. The standalone CLI parses, plans, and executes the same .md
directly, with no test runner in the way — which is most of the gap.

## Migration path, summarised

1. Symlink (or rename) `.feature` to `.md`.
2. Add `"gherkinTables"` and `"gherkinDocStrings"` to `scannerPlugins` in
   `varar.config.json` so the existing Gherkin syntax parses unchanged.
3. Re-write the step file: replace `Given('expr', fn)` / `When(...)` /
   `Then(...)` with the role function that matches what each step does —
   `context('expr', fn)` to set up state, `action('expr', fn)` to perform an
   action, `sensor('expr', fn)` to return a value Varar checks — and replace
   `World` + `Before`/`After` with a `steps(() => ({...}))` factory whose
   return value flows into each handler as the first argument.
4. Data tables arrive as `ReadonlyArray<ReadonlyArray<string>>` (header row
   first); doc strings as `string`. Both are the LAST handler argument,
   after whatever the cucumber expression captured.

That is the whole list. The handlers themselves don't change.
