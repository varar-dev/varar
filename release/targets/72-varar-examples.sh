# go.sum is excluded for a different reason than the other lockfiles: here it is
# generated under `replace ... => ../../go`, and a path-replaced module
# contributes no hash, so the file carries no varar entry at all. Copying it

# commits it — unlike uv/bundler/cargo, Go wants go.sum checked in.

# The three *_exclude arrays below are expanded with the ${a[@]+"${a[@]}"} guard
# because macOS ships bash 3.2, where `set -u` treats a plain "${a[@]}" on an
# EMPTY array as an unbound variable. An array is empty exactly when its port is
# un-parked, so the naive form fails the release on the first go-live rather
# than while parked — see the same idiom in release.sh's RESULTS loop.
#
# A parked port omits BOTH its sample directory and its workflow. Excluding only
# the directory shipped a workflow whose `working-directory` did not exist, so
# every run failed with "An error occurred trying to start process '/usr/bin/bash'
# with working directory '…/csharp-vstest'. No such file or directory" — a
# permanently red check in a public repo, for a port that has not shipped yet.
