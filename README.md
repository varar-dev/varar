# Varar

**Executable Markdown documentation for humans and agents — turn your docs into tests.**

Varar lets you write plain-Markdown examples that read like prose, then runs them
as tests: if the code stops doing what the documentation says, the test fails.
It closes the gap where code, tests, and docs quietly drift apart — so a
programmer or coding agent that breaks the oath gets caught, every time.

📖 **Full documentation, tutorials, and a live browser playground:
[varar.dev](https://varar.dev)**

Varar is a multi-language project with the same behaviour across five ports —
TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, Python, and Ruby — verified by a shared,
language-neutral [conformance](conformance/) corpus. Two further ports, Rust and
C#, are in progress.

## Build & coverage

CI status and line/branch coverage per port. Build badges reflect each port's
workflow on `main`; coverage is distilled from each tool's native report into
[`coverage.json`](coverage.json) and refreshed by `make coverage`.

## Development

This is a multi-language monorepo. Build and test every port from the repo root:

```bash
make            # build + test all ports (same gates as CI)
make typescript # one port at a time: typescript / python / java / ruby / rust
make coverage   # test with coverage in every port + regenerate coverage.json
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full workflow and
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the repository layout and architectural principles.
