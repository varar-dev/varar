# Multi-language authoring support: unified config + tree-sitter scanners for Python, Java, Kotlin

**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Status:** Approved design, unimplemented
**Realizes:** ADR 0001's "shared LSP with tree-sitter adapters" direction and its
"per-language fixtures, shared expectations" conformance strategy for the
step-definition extraction seam.

## Goal

Make the shared authoring platform (LSP, VS Code extension, snippet generation)
work end to end for step definitions written in Python, Java, and Kotlin — not
just TypeScript — with every cross-language behavior proven by the shared
conformance corpus.

Today only the TypeScript grammars/queries exist in the tree-sitter scanner
(`typescript/packages/var-language/src/tree-sitter-scanner.ts`), the LSP only
loads `var.config.ts`, and the VS Code extension only activates for
markdown/TypeScript. The runtimes for all four languages already exist and pass
the bundle conformance suite.

## Shape: four sub-projects

Each sub-project lands green on trunk and gets its own implementation plan.
Order: **A → B → C → D** (B may land in parallel with A; C needs B's fixtures;
D needs A's config and C's scanners).

| # | Sub-project | Delivers |
|---|-------------|----------|
| A | Unified `var.config.json` | One JSON config format; three thin readers (TS/Python/Java+Kotlin); old formats deleted; config conformance fixtures |
| B | Custom-parameter-type bundle | `conformance/bundles/13-custom-parameter-type/` with fixtures in all four languages + goldens; first coverage of `registry.json`'s `parameterTypes` |
| C | Tree-sitter scanners | Python/Java/Kotlin grammars + queries behind the existing `GrammarLoader`/`StepDefScanner` ports; extraction conformance test |
| D | Authoring surface | Per-language snippet templates; LSP/VS Code wiring for `.py`/`.java`/`.kt`; wasm packaging |

Decision log (from the brainstorm):

- Full end-to-end scope (scanner + config + VS Code), not scanner-only.
- `var.config.json` **fully replaces** `var.config.ts`, `pyproject.toml
  [tool.var]`, and the Java `var.*` properties — pre-1.0, no fallbacks.
- Scanner plugins in config are **named strings** resolved per-language.
- LSP features in scope for the new languages: snippet generation **and**
  handler-param extraction (signature sync), on top of the automatic ones.
- Java's parameter-type API already exists
  (`Registrar.defineParameterType(String, Pattern, Function)`, landed with the
  Kotlin port), so B is a conformance bundle, not new API work.
- Kotlin (landed on main 2026-07-02) is a first-class fourth language
  throughout.

## Sub-project A: unified `var.config.json`

### Schema

One file, `var.config.json`, at the tool's root (where `var.config.ts` sits
today). Canonical shapes only — no shorthand forms, so three readers stay
trivially conformant:

```json
{
  "docs": { "include": ["specs/**/*.md"], "exclude": ["specs/wip/*.md"] },
  "steps": ["**/*.steps.ts", "**/*_steps.py"],
  "snippets": { "typescript": "…", "python": "…" },
  "scannerPlugins": ["gherkinTables", "gherkinDocStrings"]
}
```

- The spec-discovery key is named **`docs`** (formerly `vars` in
  `var.config.ts`). The readers rename their config field to match
  (e.g. `VarConfig.docs`), so the JSON key and the code speak one language;
  call sites like the LSP store's `isVarDoc` follow the rename.
- All keys optional. Missing file or missing key = empty (`docs`/`steps`
  empty arrays, no snippets, no plugins). The old TS-only default
  `steps: ["**/*.steps.ts"]` dies with the TS-only format — a repo must
  declare its step globs, exactly as it must declare `docs` today.
- `snippets` is a flat map keyed by language id (`typescript`, `python`,
  `java`, `kotlin`) from day one so the schema never churns; until
  sub-project D, readers only consume the `typescript` key.
- A JSON Schema, `conformance/config/var.config.schema.json`, is the
  machine-readable contract (editor validation via `$schema`, reader tests).

### Readers

Each language keeps its existing `VarConfig` public type so consumers are
untouched:

- **TypeScript** — `@oselvar/var-config`'s `loadVarConfig` parses JSON instead
  of dynamic-importing a module. Plugin names resolve to `ScannerPlugin`
  functions through a name→plugin registry exported by `var-core`
  (`gherkinTables`, `gherkinDocStrings`); an unknown name is a load error.
  Delete the `var.config.ts`/`.js`/`.mjs` candidates path.
- **Python** — new `var_config` package in the uv workspace, extracted from
  `var_runner.config`; `[tool.var]` reading deleted.
- **Java** — new `var-config` Maven module; `VarConfig.java`'s properties-key
  path deleted. Kotlin consumes this module (it lives in the same Maven
  workspace and is driven by the same runner). JSON parsing approach (Jackson
  vs. minimal hand-rolled, mirroring the canonical-JSON writer) is decided at
  plan time based on the port's existing dependency posture.

### Error handling

Malformed JSON or schema-invalid values fail loudly with file path and reason.
No silent fall-back to defaults: a typo'd config that quietly discovers nothing
is the failure mode this design refuses. A *missing* file remains legal and
means "empty config", preserving today's behavior.

### Conformance

`conformance/config/` holds fixture configs — full, minimal, empty object,
missing file, malformed JSON / wrong types / unknown keys (error cases) —
plus golden canonical-JSON dumps of the parsed result (plugin *names*, not
resolved functions). An unknown plugin *name* is deliberately not a corpus
case: names are opaque at parse time in every port; only TypeScript resolves
them (at load), covered by its own unit test. Every
port's harness parses each fixture and must match the golden byte-for-byte,
same as the bundles.

### Migration in this repo

`typescript/var.config.ts` (two glob arrays, pure data) becomes
`typescript/var.config.json`. Python/Java runner-test config fixtures move to
the new format. `make check` green in the same commit series.

## Sub-project B: custom-parameter-type conformance bundle

New bundle `conformance/bundles/13-custom-parameter-type/`:

- `example.md` exercising a custom `{airport}` parameter
  (regexp `[A-Z]{3}`, transformer wrapping the raw capture).
- Four steps fixtures using each language's **existing** API:
  - `airports.steps.ts` — `defineState(() => ({}), { airport: { regexp: /[A-Z]{3}/, transformer: … } })`
  - `airports.steps.py` — `define_state(lambda: {}, param_types={"airport": {"regexp": …, "transformer": …}})`
  - `AirportsSteps.java` — `registrar.defineParameterType("airport", Pattern.compile("[A-Z]{3}"), …)`
  - `airports.steps.kt` — `parameterType("airport", Regex("[A-Z]{3}")) { … }` inside the `defineState` block
- Goldens: `registry.json` (first bundle where `parameterTypes` is non-empty —
  name + regexp source), `plan.json`, and run output like every other bundle.

Every port's existing conformance harness picks the bundle up automatically,
at the stage each port gates on: registry + plan + run for TypeScript, Python,
and Java; **registry stage only for Kotlin** (its `ConformanceTest.kt` is
deliberately registry-stage — parse/plan/trace are proven by the Java engine
underneath, per the Kotlin facade design). Any gap the bundle exposes (e.g. a
harness compiling steps before registering custom types) is fixed as part of
B. The fixtures double as sub-project C's
parameter-type extraction test corpus.

## Sub-project C: tree-sitter scanners for Python, Java, Kotlin

### Grammar loading and dialect routing

`GrammarLoader.load(languageId)` is unchanged. `createTreeSitterScanner` grows
a dialect table keyed by file extension:

| Extension | languageId | Grammar source |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| `.ts` | `typescript` | `tree-sitter-typescript` (existing) |
| `.tsx` | `typescript-tsx` | `tree-sitter-typescript` (existing) |
| `.py` | `python` | `tree-sitter-python` (prebuilt wasm in npm package) |
| `.java` | `java` | `tree-sitter-java` (prebuilt wasm in npm package) |
| `.kt` | `kotlin` | community grammar (`fwcd/tree-sitter-kotlin`) |

Dialects load **lazily on first use** — a TS-only workspace never fetches the
other wasm files. `var-lsp`'s `createNodeGrammarLoader` maps each id to its
wasm file.

**Risk (verify first at plan time):** the Kotlin community grammar may not ship
a prebuilt `.wasm`. If not, build it once and vendor the artifact; record
provenance (grammar repo + commit) next to it. This is the project's one
supply-chain wrinkle; Python/Java grammars are first-party tree-sitter
packages.

### Queries

Each language contributes the same pair the TS dialect has — a step-definition
query and a parameter-type query — plus handler-param extraction. Capture-name
conventions (`@root`, `@function-name`, `@expression`, `@name`) carry over.
`StepDef`, `ParameterTypeDef`, `HandlerParams` in
`packages/var-language/src/step-defs.ts` are **unchanged** — the extraction
seam holds exactly as ADR 0001 drew it.

- **Python** — a step def is a `decorated_definition` whose decorator is a call
  `@context|action|sensor("expr")`; the handler is the decorated
  `function_definition` (its params include `state` first, mirroring `ctx` in
  TS; `typeText` from annotations when present). Parameter types come from
  `define_state(…, param_types={"name": {"regexp": …}})` — dict-literal keys;
  regexp from a string literal or `re.compile("…")` argument.
- **Java** — a step def is a `method_invocation` named
  `context|action|sensor` with a string-literal first argument; the receiver is
  deliberately unconstrained (any binder variable name). Handler params from
  the lambda's typed parameter list. Parameter types from a
  `method_invocation` named `defineParameterType`: name from the string
  literal, regexp from the `Pattern.compile("…")` argument.
- **Kotlin** — a step def is a `call_expression` named
  `context|action|sensor` with a string first argument and a trailing-lambda
  handler; handler params from the lambda's parameter list (the state is the
  *receiver*, so — unlike the other languages — it does not appear in the
  list). Parameter types from `parameterType("name", Regex("…"), …)`.

Like the TS scanner, expression captures are **string literals only** (no
regexp/template/f-string branches — Var has no raw-regexp step definitions).
String decoding is implemented per dialect, since escape rules differ per
language (same empirical care as the existing `decodeString` /
`decodeEscapeSequence`).

### Testing

- Per-language scanner unit tests alongside the existing
  `tree-sitter-scanner.test.ts` (fixtures covering escapes, multiple defs per
  file, non-step calls that must NOT match, handler-param shapes).
- **Extraction conformance test:** for every bundle in
  `conformance/bundles/`, scan each language's steps fixture and assert the
  identical `(kind, expression)` set across languages — and, for bundle 13,
  the identical parameter-type `(name, regexp)` set. This is ADR 0001's
  "per-language fixtures, shared expectations" applied to the extraction seam.

## Sub-project D: authoring surface

### Snippet generation

`var-language`'s snippet emitter gains one default template per language
(`typescript`, `python`, `java`, `kotlin`), overridable via A's `snippets`
map. The VS Code extension picks the emit language from the config:

1. Derive the language of each glob in `config.steps` from its extension
   (`.ts`/`.tsx` → typescript, `.py` → python, `.java` → java, `.kt` →
   kotlin).
2. If exactly one language is configured, use it.
3. If more than one is configured, count the workspace files matching each
   language's steps globs and pick the language with the most files.
4. On a tie, pick the language that appears **first in `config.steps`
   order**.

The "append to which steps file?" quick-pick is then filtered to files of
the picked language, so the rendered snippet and the target file can never
disagree.

### LSP

No protocol changes. With A (config) and C (scanners) in place, `.py`/`.java`/
`.kt` step files flow through indexing, and every above-the-seam feature — go-to-def,
completion, match highlighting, diagnostics, rename with handler-signature
sync — works from the extracted `StepDef`s, including `handlerParams`.

### VS Code

- `documentSelector` and rename-provider registration derive their patterns
  from the server-reported `steps` globs (the `var/stepGlobs` request already
  exists) instead of the hardcoded `**/*.steps.ts`.
- `activationEvents` add `onLanguage:python`, `onLanguage:java`,
  `onLanguage:kotlin`.
- The packaged extension bundles all grammar wasm files next to the LSP
  server.
- `innerStringRange` (quote stripping for rename) already handles `"`/`'`
  and needs no per-language change.

---

## Out of scope

- Config formats other than `var.config.json` (no TOML/YAML/properties).
- Third-party scanner plugins (the name registry is fixed to the built-ins
  for now).
- Parameter-type extraction beyond literal shapes (e.g. a regexp held in a
  variable) — matches the TS scanner's existing literal-only stance.
- Lifecycle hooks, tags, Gherkin AST — unchanged per CLAUDE.md.
- LSP config-file *watching*/hot-reload changes beyond what exists today.

## Success criteria

1. A repo with only `var.config.json` + `.py`/`.java`/`.kt` step files gets
   full LSP behavior (diagnostics, go-to-def, completion, rename, snippets)
   in VS Code with no TypeScript anywhere in the workspace.
2. All three ports parse every `conformance/config/` fixture identically
   (golden byte-for-byte).
3. Bundle 13 passes conformance in all four languages at each port's gate
   stage (registry/plan/run for TS/Python/Java; registry for Kotlin).
4. The extraction conformance test proves identical `(kind, expression)` and
   parameter-type sets across all four languages for every bundle.
5. `make check` green; no port keeps a legacy config path.
